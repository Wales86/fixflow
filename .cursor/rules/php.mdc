- Don't generate code comments above the methods or code blocks if they are obvious. Don't add docblock comments when defining variables, unless instructed to, like `/** @var \App\Models\User $currentUser */`. Generate comments only for something that needs extra explanation for the reasons why that code was written.
- In PHP, use `match` operator over `switch` whenever possible
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion. Don't create an empty Constructor method if it doesn't have any parameters.
- Using Services in Controllers: if Service class is used only in ONE method of Controller, inject it directly into that method with type-hinting. If Service class is used in MULTIPLE methods of Controller, initialize it in Constructor.
- Use return types in functions whenever possible, adding the full path to classname to the top in `use` section
- Generate Enums always in the folder `app/Enums`, not in the main `app/` folder, unless instructed differently.
